# Gauntlet of Chaos
> This pack is focused on surviving the harsh environment in a modded hardcore scenario.  
There are multiple dangers in the form of natural disasters, new mobs, dungeons and bosses.  
In multiplayer, players can be rescued within a time limit if downed. Upon death, a corpse is left behind. Extra lives can be earned through progress.  
Follow the Quest Book (with completely custom built quests), and take on the *Gauntlet of Chaos*, as you beat each boss in the pack to restore order to the world.  
Includes some light magic and tech mods, as well as custom ship building for travel.

**Note: Still designing. Everything is subject to change.**

## Tweaked Settings
* **Physics Mod**
    * Disabled `collapse` setting, to avoid the aggressive structural integrity implementation.
* **Better Animations Collection**
    * Disabled Wobbly Creepers since they looks a bit silly.
* **Inventory Profiles**
    * Disabled Continous Crafting. It's a little confusing if enabled by default.
* **Hardcore Questing Mode**
    * Added custom logo on frontpage. (Might want to replace with more appropriate art at some point)
    * Custom quest lines and rewards.
* **Vanilla**:
    * Set GUI scale to 2 (Better default size).
    * Set music volume to 20% by default.
    * Swapped sprint and sneak controls.
