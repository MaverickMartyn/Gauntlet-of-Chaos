# Gauntlet of Chaos
> This pack is focused on surviving the harsh environment in a modded hardcore scenario.  
There are multiple dangers in the form of natural disasters, new mobs, dungeons and bosses.  
In multiplayer, players can be rescued within a time limit if downed. Upon death, a corpse is left behind. Extra lives can be earned through progress.  
Follow the Quest Book (with completely custom built quests), and take on the *Gauntlet of Chaos*, as you beat each boss in the pack to restore order to the world.  
Includes some light magic and tech mods, as well as custom ship building for travel.

* Appleskin (Better hunger HUD)
* Better Advancements
* Fast Leaf Decay
* Inventory Profiles Next

* Better Animations
* Complementary Shaders (Unbound)
* Elytra Physics (Small visual mod)

**Decoration & Building:**
* Additional Placements. (Vertical slabs! + more)
* Macaw's Doors, Fences and Walls (More variants)
* MrCrayfish' Furniture Mod
* Cooking For Blockheads (Kitchen, only if enough food mods are added)

**Gameplay:**
* Hardcore Questing Mod. (Maybe FTB Quests, if hardcore lives can be done. UI seems better)
* Hardcore Revival (Pick up downed players. 2 min. time limit?)
* Corpses (Players leave a corpse behind, holding their items upon death.)
* Supplementaries (Vanilla+ mod, much like Quark)
* Sophisticated Backpacks
* Some structural integrity mod? (implementation in the Physics mod seems a little much)
* ~~Eureka! (for airships + custom ships)~~
    * Left out for now, along with Valkyrien Skies, since the 1.20.1 version is incompatible with Rubidium 0.7.x+ at the moment.
    * Looking for fix, patch or work-around.
* Artifacts (More interesting loot)
* Curios (rings, amulets, belts etc.)
* Nature's Compass (Find any biome you need)
* Waystones
* Iron Chests (Upgradable storage)
* Tool Belt
* (?) Natural Disasters (If not too annoying, especially when people are offline)

**Bosses, Dungeons, Dimensions, etc.:**
* Aether
* Twillight Forest.
* Blue Skies
* Biomes O' Plenty (More biomes and places to see)
* When Dungeons Arise (Bigger, better dungeons)
* Lava Monsters (Just a new mob)
* Any other big boss fights
    More ocean/under-water based dungeons and bosses.

**Tech:**
* Mekanism, Mekanism Tools, Mekanism Generators and Mekanism Additions
* Create Mod
* Refined Storage

**Magic:**
* Ars Novou
* Something akin to Bewitchment/Witchery, if I can find it. Witchery is no longer maintained, and Bewitchment is Fabric only.
* maybe other magic mods?

**Under consideration:**
* Origins. Depends on how many additional Origins I can  find.

**Techinical Stuff (fixes & such):**
* CraftTweaker (Allows tweaking of recipes to solve conflicts etc.)
* Config Menus for Forge (Easier settings)
* AttributeFix (Fixes some common bugs in other mods)
* Rubidium (Forge port of Sodium. Improves Performance)

## Tweaked settings
* Disabled `collapse` setting from *Physics Mod*, to avoid the aggressive structural integrity implementation.
* Disabled Wobbly Creepers form *Better Animations Collection*, since it looks a bit silly.
* **Vanilla**:
    * Set GUI scale to 2 (Better default size).
